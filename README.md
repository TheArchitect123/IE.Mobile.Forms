# IE.Mobile.Forms
Welcome to Packman, Created by Dan Gerchcovich. 
This is part of a project used for assessing my expertise. 
It's a Xamarin Forms project that simulates packman. It works on iOS, Android and UWP. 

Technical Details: 
1. Utility Libraries and frameworks used for extending linq operations, primitive types & TPL. There are also extensions for encryption using SHA-512 algorithm
I've also added a few compression API using .Net's Gzip.

2. Mobile app consists of custom renderers, MVVM patterns and Caliburn Micro's Dependency injection container
3. Sound effects are also added and managed by dependency services managed by the Platform Services solution. 

If you would like to try this app, send me an email and I'll provide a Hockeyapp invitation for you.
